Welcome to this repository!

I learned about this project on The odin project.

It has a Index page, and three sub pages.The Index page has three dishes listed.

>These three things are food recipes :
    Lasagna 
    Chapati
    Paneer butter masala

If you click on them they will redirect you to there recipe page.

Thank's to Odin Project for this amazing project.
