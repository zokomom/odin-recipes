            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
                <li>Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl.
                    Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and oil. Mix until a soft,
                    elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed.</li>
                <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis.
                    Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.
                    Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin.</li>
                <li>When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it.
                    Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more.</li>
                <li>Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
            </ol>
